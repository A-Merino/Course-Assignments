I pledge that every program with my name on it shall be written by me
(and my co-authors, if any).  Every program I submit shall be entirely
my own work unless otherwise attributed.  I understand that academic
dishonesty not only includes copying other people's work, but also
abetting or facilitating copying.  Code that is substantially similar
to any other submission past or present will get no credit whatever
the explanation.  I understand that the consequence of academic
dishonesty is a grade of 'F' for the class.  I pledge to devote my
efforts to learning and exploring Java by writing and testing my own
programs.  I shall strive to be attentive to detail and write programs
that not only compile and execute correctly, but are easily
understandable by myself and other programmers.
