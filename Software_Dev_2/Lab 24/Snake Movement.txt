To start you need to import this class first if you havent already
import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;
https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/event/KeyEvent.html


The class holds mainly all of the integer values of the keys instead of typing 119 each time, which makes it easier
For arrow keys the names are:
   VK_DOWN
   VK_UP
   VK_RIGHT
   VK_LEFT
For WASD:
   VK_W
   VK_A
   VK_S
   VK_D

The way I implemented it was using a while loop that would check for all possiblities each time the snake moved:
   Was a key pressed and was it a legal key press? (cant go directly up if youre going down)
      Change the direction if so
   Once that is determined move the snake one spot in that direction

      Now that the snake moved check to see if it went over the spot that the apple/food is in
         if it did grow the snake one (let the last unit stay where it is)
            Also need to make a new apple now
               Use a randomizer (I used Math.random())
               Make sure the apple isn't placed where the snake is
         if it didn't keep the snake the same length
   Then check to see if the snake dead
      If it went out of bounds/if it hit itself
         Game is over
         I used a boolean which controlled the while loop
            while (isAlive) {}


The way I implemented the snake was an ArrayList of a class i made which held two doubles which were the x and y coordinates
